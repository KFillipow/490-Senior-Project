# 490-Senior-Project
This is the source code of my senior design project. This code samples the ADC from the MSP432P401R, then outputs the adc data through a 
UART. Then the ADC data is transformed to the frequency domain by using the CMSIS FFT function. The results of the FFT are output through
the UART as well.

I use MatLab to implement the K-nearest neighbor pattern recognition and to write the relevant sampled data to a file. The data from the 
file is then used to calculate the nearest group from the sampled data.
